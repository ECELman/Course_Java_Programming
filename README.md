     課堂作業與專題
     
     作業一 : 
     1. 設定一個答案，然後讓使用者輸入2個整數，如這2個整數的合等於這個答案，則由螢幕輸出”正確”，如猜錯，則輸出”錯誤”。 
     2. 請讓使用者輸入5個數字，然後螢幕輸出這5個數字的總合。

     作業二 :
     1. Write a program which sums two random integers and lets the user repeatedly enter a new answer
        until it is correct.
     2. Write a program which sums positive integers from the input except for -1 to exit, and displays 
        the sum.
     3. Write a program which allows the user to enter positive integers except for -1 to exit, and displays
        the maximum.
     4. 寫一個猜數字的game，先隨機產生四個數字，接著可以輸入4個猜測的數字，數字是有順序性的，然後程式必需告訴你，
        猜對1個數字的位置回報1A，猜對1個數字回報1B。
     5. A designer is trying to create a new pattern of five stripes using three colors. These colors and   
        their codes are mentioned in the table below. The designer has to keep in mind that no two adjacent 
        stripes are of the same color. For example, RRGBR is an invalid pattern, but RGBRB is valid.

        Write a program that accepts a sequence of five colors as input from the designer to form the 
        pattern. At each selection the designer makes, the program should check if the input is from among 
        the available set of colors. Also, the program should check that adjacent colors are not the 
        same. At the end, the program should display the final stripe pattern created.
        
     作業三 :
     1. Write a sorting algorithm by the values in descending order.
     2. Write a program which allows the user to enter the math grades one by one (-1 to exit), and outputs
        a histogram.
     3. Write a program which picks first five cards at random from a deck of 52 cards
        注意與步驟 :
        (1) 4 suits: Spade, Heart, Diamond, Club
        (2) 13 ranks: 2; : : : ; 10, J, Q, K, A
        (3) Labeling 52 cards by 0; 1; ; 51 by a certain rule
        (4) Shuffle the numbers
        (5) Pick up the first 5 cards
